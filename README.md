# E-commerce Back End

## Description

The E-commerce Back End is a web application that serves as the backend for an e-commerce website. The purpose of this project is to provide a robust and scalable backend solution for an e-commerce website. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete products, categories, and tags, making it easier to manage the inventory and organize products in the online store.

This project helped me learn to utilizes Node.js, Express.js, and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database and perform CRUD operations on the data.
